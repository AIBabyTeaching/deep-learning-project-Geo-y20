- Navigate to Parameters section, this is where you can adjust all input parameters to your network, for example,
  <br />1. Number of hidden neurons<br /> 2. learning Rate <br />3. Momentum<br />4. Size of the normalized image.<br />
- Samples folder contain all training samples for OCR-EXTENDED font.
- Paragraphs contain the input document(IMAGE) to be recognized. To input your own document, change the documentLocation variable to your document name.
